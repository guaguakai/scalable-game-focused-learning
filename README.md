# Scalable Game-Focused Learning
This is the implementation of the work "Scalable Game-Focused Learning of Adversary Models: Data-to-Decisions in Network Security Games", Kai Wang, Andrew Perrault, Aditya Mate, and Milind Tambe. in AAMAS 2020

- **blockQP.py**: the main file which includes the training and data generation. You can simply run ""python3 blockQP.py""
- **graphData.py**: the file to generate synthetic dataset and other helper functions.
- **gcn.py**: our learning model graph convolutional network
- **derivative.py**: all the helper functions responsible for optimization, computing first order derivative, and second order derivative.
